    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Type of Probability Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario described can be accurately portrayed by a **Binomial Distribution**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Binomial Distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (i.e., trials with two possible outcomes, such as success and failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Conditions of the Binomial Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Binomial Distribution follows these three conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed Number of Trials (n)**:\n",
    "   - The experiment consists of a fixed number of trials. In this case, there are 10 drugs being tested.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Independent Trials**:\n",
    "   - Each trial is independent of the others. The outcome of one drug's effectiveness does not affect the outcome of another.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Constant Probability of Success (p)**:\n",
    "   - The probability of success (producing a satisfactory result) is constant for each trial. According to the problem, it is 4 times more likely for a drug to produce a satisfactory result than not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the theoretical probability that at most 3 drugs are not able to do a satisfactory job, we can use the Binomial Distribution formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ P(X \\leq k) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\binom{n}{i} p^i (1-p)^{n-i} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the number of trials (10 in this case).\n",
    "- \\( p \\) is the probability of failure (not satisfactory).\n",
    "- \\( 1-p \\) is the probability of success (satisfactory).\n",
    "- \\( X \\) is the random variable representing the number of failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that it is 4 times more likely for a drug to be satisfactory than not, let \\( q \\) be the probability of failure (not satisfactory). Then, the probability of success (satisfactory) \\( p \\) can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ p = 4q \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Since \\( p + q = 1 \\):\n",
    "\n",

    "\\[ 5q = 1 \\]\n",
    "\\[ q = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \\]\n",
    "\\[ p = 1 - q = 0.8 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability of failure \\( q \\) (not satisfactory) is 0.2, and the probability of success \\( p \\) (satisfactory) is 0.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can calculate the probability that at most 3 drugs are not satisfactory:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Properties of the Confidence Interval Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample Mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\))**:\n",
    "   - The average time of effect in the sample, which is 207 seconds.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Sample Standard Deviation (s)**:\n",
    "   - The standard deviation of the sample, which is 65 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sample Size (n)**:\n",
    "   - The number of observations in the sample, which is 100 drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Confidence Level**:\n",
    "   - The desired confidence level is 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Standard Error of the Mean (SEM)**:\n",
    "   - SEM is calculated as \\( \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} \\).\n",
    "   - In this case, SEM = \\( \\frac{65}{\\sqrt{100}} = \\frac{65}{10} = 6.5 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Critical Value (Z\\(_{\\alpha/2}\\))**:\n",
    "   - For a 95% confidence level, the critical value from the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) is approximately 1.96.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence Interval Calculation:\n",
    "The 95% confidence interval for the population mean is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\bar{x} \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\text{SEM} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the values:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Computation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ 207 \\pm 12.74 \\]\n",

    "Now, once the batch has passed all the quality tests and is ready to be launched in the market, the marketing team needs to plan an effective online ad campaign to attract new customers. Two taglines were proposed for the campaign, and the team is currently divided on which option to use.\n",

    "### A/B Testing for Tagline Effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "**A/B testing** (or split testing) is a method used to compare two versions of a webpage, ad, or any other marketing material to determine which one performs better. In this case, we will use A/B testing to compare the effectiveness of two taglines for an online ad campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use A/B Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** It allows decisions to be made based on data rather than assumptions or opinions.\n",
    "- **Objective Comparison:** Provides a scientific way to compare the performance of two different taglines.\n",
    "- **User-Centric:** Measures actual user behavior and reactions to the taglines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Procedure for Conducting A/B Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Define the Goal\n",
    "The primary goal is to determine which tagline leads to more conversions (e.g., click-throughs, sign-ups, or purchases).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Formulate Hypotheses\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\))**: There is no difference in effectiveness between Tagline A and Tagline B.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\))**: There is a difference in effectiveness between Tagline A and Tagline B.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Identify Key Metrics\n",
    "Decide on the metrics to measure the effectiveness. Common metrics include:\n",
    "- Click-through rate (CTR)\n",
    "- Conversion rate\n",
    "- Engagement rate\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Select the Sample Size\n",
    "Determine the sample size needed to achieve statistical significance. Tools like online sample size calculators can be used to calculate the required number of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Randomly Assign Users\n",
    "Randomly divide the users into two groups:\n",
    "- **Group A**: Sees Tagline A\n",
    "- **Group B**: Sees Tagline B\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Run the Test\n",
    "- **Duration**: Ensure the test runs for a sufficient period to collect enough data (e.g., a few days to a couple of weeks).\n",
    "- **Consistent Conditions**: Ensure both groups experience the same conditions except for the tagline.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7: Collect Data\n",
    "Monitor and record the performance of both taglines based on the defined metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 8: Analyze Results\n",
    "Use statistical analysis to compare the performance of the two taglines. A common approach is to use a chi-square test for proportions if comparing conversion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 9: Make a Decision\n",
    "Based on the statistical analysis:\n",
    "- **If the null hypothesis is rejected**: Choose the tagline with the higher conversion rate.\n",
    "- **If the null hypothesis is not rejected**: Either tagline can be used as there is no significant difference in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 10: Implement the Winning Tagline\n",
    "Deploy the more effective tagline across the entire campaign to maximize conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing is a robust method for making data-driven decisions about which tagline to use in the online ad campaign. By following the outlined steps, the marketing team can ensure that they choose the tagline that is most likely to attract new customers and achieve the desired business outcomes."
